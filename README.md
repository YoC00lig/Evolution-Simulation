<h1> Evolution-simulation project</h1>
<p> Darwinian-evolution-simulation project written as part of the "Object-oriented programming" course. </p>
<p> The application enables the user to create own simulation with selected parameters and monitoring statistics related to the number of deaths, average energy level, free fields etc. </p>
<p> Several simulations can be run simultaneously, so it is possible to keep track and compare results.</p>

<h2> Idea description: </h2>
<p> The idea of this project is based on Darwin's theory. Every day the animals move, eat, 
reproduce and die. Each of them has a certain amount of energy which is lost by performing daily 
activities and gained by eating grass. They have their own genotype assigned at birth that 
determines their next move and which they partially inherit from their parents.</p>

<p> Grass doesn't grow the same everywhere. As in the normal world, it is more likely to grow 
in preferred fields. The location of these fields depends on the preferences selected at the start.</p>

<p> The world is not fair. Is there such a configuration that will help animals survive as 
long as possible? Check it yourself.</p>
